Doordash Machine Learning Data Scientist Interview 
Round 1: Take home assignment
Given a dataset, build a machine learning model to predict food delivery time in different time buckets: < 10 mins, 10â€“30 mins, > 30 mins.


Doordash Machine Learning Data Data Scientist Virtual Onsite Interview:
Round 1: behavioral questions and product sense
Why Doordash?
What do you think is the main reason a Doordash driver failed to deliver a complete order, e.g., a customer ordered three tacos, but only two were delivered.
How can we solve the missing food item issue and help improve customer experience?


Round 2: machine learning case study

How do we build a machine learning system to forecast demand?
How do we keep improving the system?

Round 3. product sense: AB testing

Give me three metrics to evaluate our food delivery time forecasting model.
How do we evaluate and compare a new food delivery time forecasting ML model vs. the existing one?
What are the potential issues if we run an AB testing on the new and current model?
Based on the AB testing result, how do you decide whether to launch the new model or not?

Round 4: product sense: metrics
How do you measure driver and food delivery experience?
How to improve driver response rate?
How can we get more drivers to join Doordash?
